## Vertex-k8400

### Settings for Cura

This repo contains my gcode tweaks for the k8400 which make the printer work more like an ultimaker2.

The start gcode will move the head to the front-left corner and extrude some plastic to ensure good adhesion to the buildplate right from the start of the print.

The end gcode will move the bed down out of the way when the print finishes.

### To use: 
Just need to cut 'n' paste the relevant files into 'Machine Settings' screen in the Cura printer config.

There are two different set of settings - One for single extruder and one for dual extruder.

Happy Printing!!
